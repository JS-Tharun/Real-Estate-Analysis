# Real-Estate-Analysis
A full-featured streamlit app to explore real estate data.

The project aims to build a **Real Estate Listings Dashboard** that uses **SQL and Streamlit** to:
* Analyze property listings, agent performance, and sales patterns.
* Provide insights into pricing, time on market, and property types.
* Enable filtering by location, property type, price, and sales agent.
* Display interactive visuals like maps and bar charts for better understanding.
